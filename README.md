# Spaceship Titanic - Machine Learning Project 🚀

A **Kaggle competition project** that predicts whether a passenger was transported to another dimension during the *Spaceship Titanic* journey.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

- 🔍 **Objective:** Predict whether a passenger was transported or not based on personal, travel, and onboard service features.
- 📊 Built using a **Jupyter Notebook** for training the model.
- 🖥️ Deployed using **Streamlit** as the frontend.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Interactive **Streamlit web app** to make predictions
- Load the trained `.pkl` model and predict outcomes based on input
- Uses **preprocessed and engineered features** from the original dataset

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook for data processing, training, and exporting the model
